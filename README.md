# understanding_and_visualizing_convolutional_networks
Repo to visualize and understand convolutional neural networks which will eventually help to have more grasp in ml thesis or projects.

It is often said that seeing is beliving. Thus when we see that which part of our neural network is extracting which type of feature then it becomes more clearer what should be done next or the process or idea is really working or not. Thus I tried to understand it as well. 

This is the implementation of [this paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)

The implementation was mainly taken from [this repo.](https://github.com/saketd403/Visualizing-and-Understanding-Convolutional-neural-networks) But had to change at several places.
